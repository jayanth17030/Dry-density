            <p  class="sides"><b>PREPARATION SAMPLE</b></p>
            <p>Obtain a sufficient quantity (10 kg) of air-dried soil and pulverize it. Take about 5 kg of soil passing through 19mm sieve in a mixing tray.</p>
         </div>

            <p   class="sides"><b>PROCEDURE</b></p>
            <p>1. 5 Kg. of soil is taken and the water is added to it to bring its moisture content to about 4 % in coarse grained soils and 8% in case of fine grained soils with the help of graduated cylinder <br>
               2. The mould with base plate attached is weighed to the nearest 1 gm (M1). The extension collar is to be attached with the mould. <br>
               3. Then the moist soil in the mould is compacted in three equal layers, each layer being given 25 blows from the 2.6 Kg rammer dropped from a height of 310 mm. above the soil. <br>
               4. The extension is removed and the compacted soil is leveled off carefully to the top of the mould by means of a straight edge. <br>
               5. Then the mould and soil is weighed to the nearest 1 gm. (M2). <br>
               6. The soil is removed from the mould and a representative soil sample is obtained water content determination. <br>
               7. Steps 3 to 6 are repeated after adding suitable amount of water to the soil in an increasing order.</p>

            <p class="sides"><b>CALCULATION</b></p>
            <p>Bulk density, gm in g/cm3 at each compacted specimen is  calculated from the equation.</p>

            <p>where Vm = volume of mould in cm3 <br>
               The dry density, gd, in g/cm3, is calculated from the equation.</p>
            <img src="procedureImg3.webp" alt="">
            <p>where w = moisture content of soil in percent.</p>
            <p>The dry densities, gd obtained in a series of determinations are plotted against the corresponding moisture content. A smooth curve is then drawn through the resulting points and the position of the maximum on this curve is determined.</p>

            <p  class="sides"><b>REPORT</b></p>
            <p>The maximum dry density in g/cm3 is to be reported to the nearest 0.01 and the optimum moisture content is to be reported to the nearest 0.5.</p>

            <p  class="sides"><b>SAFETY & PRECAUTIONS</b></p>
            <p>
            1. Use hand gloves & safety shoes while compacting. <br>
            2. Adequate period (about 15 minutes for clayey soils and 56 minutes for coarse grained soils) is allowed after mixing the water and before compacting into the mould. <br>
            3. The blows should be uniformly distributed over the surface of each layer. <br>
