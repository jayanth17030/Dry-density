                    <b>Where do we consider the light compaction test and heavy compaction?</b>
                    <p>Selection of Light compaction and Heavy compaction test depends upon the condition that what type of compaction method you are using in the field, if you are using heavy rollers to compact the soil then to simulate the site condition you have to use heavy compaction test otherwise light compaction.</p>

                    <b>Where and why heavy compaction & light compaction use in CBR test?</b>
                    <p>CBR test which is short for California Bearing Ratio is a test conducted on soil which is the subgrade to decide thickness of flexible pavements coming over it. In this test the load corresponding to penetration of a plunger is noted for different penetrations. The load corresponding to 2.5mm n 5 mm are noted down . The CBR is considered as the ratio of load corresponding to 2.5mm penetration to that of standard load or ratio of load corresponding to 5mm to that of standard load for same penetration expressed as percentage. Most often the ratio corresponding to 2.5mm works out to be higher that that corresponding to 5.0mm penetration and is taken as the CBR of that sample. The compaction for CBR depends upon wat kind of compaction has been done on the subgrade sample for determining its MDD(max dry density) and OMC(optimum moisture content). So if its light compaction the amount (weight)sample for CBR is calculated using normally a percentage fraction of MDD(eg 97%MDD) and adding the OMC. The CBR mould is filled by compaction sample in three layers each using 55blows per layer as per IS 2720 (part16). For heavy compaction therefore the CBR Ssample will be compacted in five layers 55 blows each.</p>

                    <b>Soil has 80% compaction. To get 90% compaction, what do we have to do?</b>
                    <p> It depends on the soil, and the condition of it. Soil compaction is defined as the density of the soil, or how tightly it is packed. 100 % density means the maximum amount of a given material is present in a sampled volume. Large particle soils have more voids than small particle soils, so the physical density isn’t the same. Plastic soils don’t compact like cohesive soils, and those don’t compact like sandy soil. Compacting plastic soils without a means of confining them displaces the soil rather than increasing the density, and compacting cohesive soil in deep lifts, say 2 feet at a time results in the surface becoming very hard and bridging the soil down deeper so it doesn’t compact well. Sandy soils can be compacted by flooding, the water settles the sand as it percolates through it, filling voids with smaller grains and leaving them closer together.

                        As a rule of thumb, find the optimum moisture of the soil you are compacting, and try to maintain the moisture during rolling or tamping. If the soil becomes too wet, you have to let it dry (or till it to speed drying), if it becomes too dry, add water to bring the moisture up. Normally, most soils compact best at between 12–18% moisture, but a geotechnical engineer or a testing lab technician can advise more accurately for a particular soil.
                        
                        As far as the question goes, 90% compaction is usually easy to achieve with ordinary methods if the moisture is good. Small areas can often be tamped with a plate tamp, either manually or with a gasoline powered one. Larger areas can be rolled, or if a roller isn’t available, by driving a truck or tractor back and forth over the soil (assuming the soil will support it). Even walking on soil improves compaction. If ordinary methods of compaction don’t resolve your issues, you may have subgrade problems like working too near the water table where the materials pump rather than compact, or the subgrade simply isn’t stable enough to support the soil being compacted. In this case, you have to over-excavate the existing soil and backfill with better fill materials.

                    <b>What is the difference between compaction and consolidation?</b>
                    <p>Consolidation: The process of removing the water content from the given material such as soil, concrete etc <br>

                        Compaction: The process of removing the air content from the given material such as soil, concrete, etc</p>

                    <b>How do you find the degree of compaction?
                    </b>
                    <p>How do you find the degree of compaction?
                        Typically engineers establish what degree/percentage of compaction is needed for a situation. Then the appropriate material (dirt/gravel/other) is either located or imported. Then the material is compacted by one or more of the five basic forms of compaction to the specified percent of compaction.</p>
